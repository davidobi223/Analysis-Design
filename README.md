# Analysis-Design
Project 1&2;

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For project one (CS 300 pseudocode document), I had to define how each program opens files, parses each line of data, reads each line of data, checks for formatting errors, and I also had to show how to create course objects. In project 2 or "module7project" I designed a code that would print a course list from the users input. 

# How did you approach the problem?
For both projects I went over past work I had previously did and implemented the neccesary information I learned from them into the two projects I had. 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
If I had any problems I went back to my course book to go over any certain problems or I went to a tutor for any further help.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I learned how to make different projects using hashtables, vectors, and binary search trees while working on both assignments. This has expaned my ability of storing data in different manners depending on which one fits the project I'm working on. 

# How has your work on this project/s evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on the second project helped me with making binary search trees that I can adapt and maintain with new data and information.
